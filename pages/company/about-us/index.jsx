                FirstStep.Baby is the brainchild of two friends—a passionate
                React Developer and a seasoned Digital Marketer—who shared a
                common vision: to create a website unlike any other, featuring
                an unparalleled database of baby names from around the world.
              </p>
              <br></br>
              <p>
                As they embarked on this journey, they tackled each element of
                the website one thread at a time, pouring their expertise and
                dedication into bringing their vision to life. The result?
                FirstStep.Baby—a platform that offers a vast collection of over
                3 million baby names, spanning Indian, Arabic, Chinese,
                American, German, French, African, and Australian origins. Each
                name is accompanied by its meaning, origin, and even numerology
                insights, providing parents with a comprehensive resource for
                choosing the perfect name for their little one.

                At FirstStep.Baby, our mission is to empower parents and
                families to make informed decisions about their child's name,
                ensuring that it reflects their cultural heritage, values, and
                aspirations. We believe that a name is more than just a
                label—it's a gift that shapes a child's identity and journey
                through life.
